                    This is Aerial, a single page, single screen responsive site template. Real simple.
                    Makes heavy use of CSS animation (something I've been messing with a lot lately).
                    Should work well as a landing page that just directs folks to your stuff elsewhere
                    on the www. Sass sources are also included, so if you've never used Sass and you're
                    interested in giving it a try, head on over to sass-lang.com (and if not, you can
                    safely delete the "sass/" folder).
                </p>
